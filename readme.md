    cd resume-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**
    * Navigate to the server directory:

        ```
    * Install backend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory. Use the structure below:
        ```env
        # The port for your backend server
        PORT=5001

        # Your PostgreSQL connection string
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

        # Your Google AI (Gemini) API Key
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
        See the **Environment Variables** section below for more details.
    * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        node server.js
        ```
        The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

3.  **Frontend Setup**
    * Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:
        ```bash
        cd client
        ```
    * Install frontend dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Start the Vite development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
